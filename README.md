MOJO is a gaming project built around a pixel art world inspired by classic arcade titles. It aims to capture the feel of old school machines, where gameplay is fast, simple to learn, and rewarding to master. 
Instead of just copying the past, it rebuilds those ideas with modern mechanics and a cleaner visual style while keeping the charm of chunky pixels, short action loops, and quick decision making.

What makes MOJO different is how it uses blockchain. Items, achievements, characters, or any in-game progress can be owned by the players instead of being locked inside the game servers. 
This means you can trade what you earn, buy rare pieces from other players, or keep your upgrades even if the game evolves over time. Blockchain also helps create transparent economies, 
which can make events, rewards, and challenges feel more meaningful because players know their progress has real value.

In short, MOJO takes the best parts of vintage arcade gaming, updates them for today’s tastes, and adds blockchain so the time and skill you put in becomes something you actually control.
